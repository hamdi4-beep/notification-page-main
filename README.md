## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This challenged taught me how to be more analytical with the elements' structure so I can avoid falling into traps, such as using the wrong layout style.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I would to focus a lot more on being able to depict the relationship between the elements so I can develop a sharper sense of what tools are going to be useful for the right solution.

I don't like to overcomplicate the development process so I want to come up with a solution that keeps the codebase simple and easy to understand.
